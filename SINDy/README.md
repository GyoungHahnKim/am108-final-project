Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics
===========================================

**SINDy** is a python 2.7 library for system identification problems. It is based on the original paper by Brunton *et al.* (Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems, *PNAS*, vol. **113** (15), pp. 3932--3937, 2016).

Examples
--------

Examples can be found in the 'repo <https://github.com/loiseaujc/SINDy/tree/master/examples>' along with an illustratory Jupyter-Notebook.

INSTALLATION
------------
Create and activate a fresh virtual environment running python 2.7. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then `python setup.py install`. To run the Jupyter notebook example, install ipykernel: `pip install ipykernel` and then add the kernel to ipython: `ipython kernel install --user --name={env_name}`
